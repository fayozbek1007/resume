                        I am Front-End Developer and have 6 months of experience. During the course, we worked on many sites. For example, we completed The Movie Database (TMDB), GreenShop, Ht-med.uz and other projects. I mainly made projects in React.js and Next.js. I used Tailwenda.css for css. I am also trying to work on big projects. Because big and real projects teach me a lot.
